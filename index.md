I am studying physical oceanography at School of Oceanography and Applied Physics Lab (APL), University of Washington (UW) since 2021. I am joint advised by <a href="https://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Zhao&first_name=Zhongxiang">Zhongxiang Zhao</a> and Dr. Eric D'Asaro. Previous to that, I earned a Master's Degree of Environmental Engineering from Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University in 2021.

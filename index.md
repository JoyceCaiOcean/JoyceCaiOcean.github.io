### My current research focuses on the dynamics of varying internal tidal waves in the changing ocean, using a combination of in-situ observations and satellite altimetry data. ###

I am studying physical oceanography at the School of Oceanography and Applied Physics Lab (APL), University of Washington (UW), since 2021. I am jointly advised by <a href="https://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Zhao&first_name=Zhongxiang">Zhongxiang Zhao</a> and <a href="https://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=D%27Asaro&first_name=Eric">Eric D'Asaro</a>. Prior to that, I earned a Master's of Science in Environmental Engineering from Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University in 2021.

I was born in Guangzhou, China, and lived there for 22 years. As a Cantonese foodie, my childhood dream was to be a chef like Gordon Ramsay (still!). Besides cooking, I like travel, badminton, and outdoor activities. Learn more <a href="https://joycecaiocean.github.io/life/">here</a>.

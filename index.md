Since 2021, I have been pursuing my passion for physical oceanography at the School of Oceanography and Applied Physics Lab (APL), University of Washington (UW), under the joint guidance of esteemed advisors <a href="https://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Zhao&first_name=Zhongxiang">Zhongxiang Zhao</a> and <a href="https://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=D%27Asaro&first_name=Eric">Eric D'Asaro</a>. Before this, I obtained a Master's of Science in Environmental Engineering from Stanford University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the same year.

Hailing from the bustling city of Guangzhou, China, I spent 22 wonderful years there before embarking on my academic journey. As a self-professed Cantonese foodie, I harbored childhood dreams of emulating the fiery culinary expertise of the legendary Gordon Ramsay (which I still aspire to today!). When I'm not whipping up delectable dishes, I indulge in my love for travel, badminton, and the great outdoors.

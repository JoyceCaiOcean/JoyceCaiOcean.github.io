This is the place where I can share the other side of myself!

## Places

#### Hometown: Guangzhou, China
I had a happy and normal childhood with those who loved me the most. Even though I was an only child, I never felt lonely because of the love that surrounded me.

When I was a kid, I used to play on the campus where I later attended undergraduate school; Sun Yat-sen University.

#### Lund, Sweden
After studying in the same place for 20 years, I felt a strong desire to explore the world outside. This led me to apply for an exchange program in Lund, Sweden - a place where every girl's dream of being a princess comes true. My experience at Lund University was incredible, and I had the opportunity to meet many amazing people. During the Christmas break, I seized the opportunity to volunteer in Greece and also traveled around Europe on a budget.

Here is the place to share the other side of me!

## Places

#### Hometown
I have a happy and normal childhood around with whom loves me most. I am the only child but I never feel lonely being outsides.

#### Lund, Sweden
After taking schooling in the same place for 20 years, I like to see what the world outside looks like. So, I applied for an exchange study in Lund, Sweden, where all girl's princesses dream lies in.

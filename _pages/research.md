My journey in marine science began in the picturesque Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in Guangdong, China. Driven by a desire to comprehend the complex dynamics of tidal energy transportation and dissipation in the PRE, I delved deep into my research, examining the impact of human activities over the past 50 years. Upon moving to California, I redirected my focus to the captivating San Francisco Bay, where I immersed myself in the wonders of its marine environment. Enthralled by the enigmatic allure of the vast open ocean, I expanded my research interests to study the intriguing phenomenon of internal tides in the deep sea.

## Internal Tides Analysis from SWOT Pre‑launch In‑situ Measurements
Graduate Research Assistant, University of Washington, Applied Physics Laboratory
*Seattle, WA, USA. March 2021 - Present*
* Advisors: Zhongxiang Zhao and Eric D’Asaro
* Quantify the Spatiotemporal variation of Internal Tides near Monterey Bay, CA, by comparing 3 moorings data from SWOT Cal/Val Pre‑launch Field Campaign 2019 with satellite altimetry results


## Sediment erosion and computational fluid dynamics

Independent Research Assistant, Stanford University

*Stanford, CA, USA. June 2020 - September 2020*
* Advisor: Oliver Fringer
* Reviewed literature on both the empirical and numerical methods of incipient motion for granular material transport with turbulent channel flows. Established a more concrete understanding of the hydrodynamics of particle‑laden flows by evaluating previous Eulerian‑Lagrangian (EL) studies on fluid‑particle and particle‑particle interactions
* Visualized the fluid‑particle interaction by conducting a two‑dimensional particle‑resolved simulation using the Immersed Boundary method in MATLAB














## Ongoing and future work

The following are several projects that I have been actively working on (or just thinking about!). Of course, not all of these will be completed in the next few years of my PhD. [Contact me](mailto:ethancc@uw.edu) if any of these sound interesting or if you are engaged in similar research. I would be excited to collaborate!

* Reconstruction of Antarctic sea ice formation and melt from ocean salinity
* Impact of storms on the upper ocean under sea ice
* Snow loss processes on sea ice
* Effects of Taylor column dynamics on mixing, deep ventilation, and biogeochemistry
* Changes in Southern Hemisphere subpolar gyre strength under anthropogenic forcing
* Pathways of Antarctic Bottom Water formation during glacial climates

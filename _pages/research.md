## Studying tides From Estuaries to the Ocean
My journey in marine science began in the picturesque Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in Guangdong, China. Driven by a desire to comprehend the complex dynamics of tidal energy transportation and dissipation in the PRE, I delved deep into my research, examining the impact of human activities over the past 50 years. Upon moving to California, I redirected my focus to the captivating San Francisco Bay, where I immersed myself in the wonders of its marine environment. Enthralled by the enigmatic allure of the vast open ocean, I expanded my research interests to study the intriguing phenomenon of internal tides in the deep sea.

## Internal Tides Analysis from SWOT Pre‑launch In‑situ Measurements

**Phytoplankton blooms in the Antarctic seasonal ice zone are limited by light and iron. 

## Ongoing and future work

The following are several projects that I have been actively working on (or just thinking about!). Of course, not all of these will be completed in the next few years of my PhD. [Contact me](mailto:ethancc@uw.edu) if any of these sound interesting or if you are engaged in similar research. I would be excited to collaborate!

* Reconstruction of Antarctic sea ice formation and melt from ocean salinity
* Impact of storms on the upper ocean under sea ice
* Snow loss processes on sea ice
* Effects of Taylor column dynamics on mixing, deep ventilation, and biogeochemistry
* Changes in Southern Hemisphere subpolar gyre strength under anthropogenic forcing
* Pathways of Antarctic Bottom Water formation during glacial climates
